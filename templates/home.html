  We are incredibly excited to revive Boston's BitDevs meetup! It's been over
  2.5 years since our last meetup, and we cannot wait to see you in person this
  Thursday.
</p>

<p>
  Boston BitDevs is a Bitcoin-focused, more technical meetup. Like all worldwide
  BitDevs groups, we run a Socratic Seminar (learn more
  <a href="https://bitdevs.org/about">here</a>).
</p>
<p>
  If you're looking to learn about Bitcoin's latest technical developments, this
  is the event for you! Whether you're a long-time Bitcoiner looking to
  participate in the discussion, or a new Bitcoiner hoping to soak up technical
  information like a sponge, all are welcome.
</p>
